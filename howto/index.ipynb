    "# Creating hardware in Python using CyriteHDL\n",
    "\n",
    "CyriteHDL or short CyHDL is a **hardware definition toolkit** based on a kernel using an internal representation python notation to generate hardware or code procedurally. It is featured by an emulation layer to provide some (not full) language compatibility to the MyHDL dialect. It is assumed that you have some knowledge of Verilog or VHDL.\n",
