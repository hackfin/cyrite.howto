    "## Detailed explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens here is the following:\n",
    "* `self.unit` is compiled as CXXRTL back end module and is imported ad-hoc\n",
    "* The signals passed to its interface are connected to the backend, i.e. they are consumed and driven by the latter.\n",
    "* The `co_*` signals are not connected to the back end and are thus handled by the cosimulation layer upon occuring events, such as a `clk.posedge`.\n",
    "* All functionality in the `testbench()` function runs as native python. Therefore one has to ensure that calls to macros are evaluated explicitely or the `yield from` constructs are used for context sensitive `@rtl_function`s or `@cyrite_method`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine from the code, in which domain the code is executed or evaluated, the thumb rule applies:\n",
    "* `self.always(...)` runs here in native execution\n",
    "* `always(...)` is transpiled to hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Co-Processes running in the native Python context pretty much allow any kind of Python extension looped in and only a small built-in sub set of Python can be transpiled to HDL."

    "## Performance aspects: Event signals\n",
    "\n",
    "A Co-Simulator is normally the driving force in a design, creating the external stimuli for a pure digital design without functional delay simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the above `@self.always` co-processes will only react to external stimuli caused by `EventSignal` types. The reason for this is performance: all combinatorial signal dependencies of their sources are sorted out by the faster back end. The co-simulation front end should only have to set a few signals, provide a clock and a reset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies certain restrictions:\n",
    "* No clock generators inside the synthesized RTL, for instance, PLLs can not be simulated this way.\n",
    "* co-processes can only use EventSignal types in their sensitivity list\n",
    "* `@sequence` functions can only wait for events of EventSignals as well, i.e. constructs such as `s.posedge` will only work for a clock signal type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Event signals, like outputs of the simulation of the compiled backend unit will thus have to be polled explicitely for changes."

    "### Native simulation issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the Co-Simulation layer is very rudimentary and does not allow to simply run a hardware design on the native co-simulation side.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the support for co-processes is limited to:\n",
    "* Direct assignments of signals, no combinatorial logic\n",
    "* `@self.always()` only allowed for:\n",
    "    * Event types caused by EventSignal types (ClkSignal, ResetSignal, ..)\n",

    "    * Co-processes inside the testbench top, i.e. no hierarchy\n",
