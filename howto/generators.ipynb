    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We note: There can be two representations of a Python routine. Since Python does neither allow us to use custom If..Else classes in its native dialect, nor can we override an assignment of a variable, we are a priori required to explicitely write down a dual representation for the same thing, if we want to execute and generate. The other, context sensitive option, is to use a decorator for a routine that does the following:\n",
    "* AST translation within a generator context to a generator representation using `yield`\n",
    "* Untouched execution of the function when in a native python execution context\n",
    "\n",
    "## The myIRL internal representation\n",
    "\n",
    "When decorating a top level function with a cyhdl `@block` statement, its child funclets will be examined for specific decorator keywords and translation to the **IRL** (internal representation language) will occur. Note that there is a `@myirl.block` wrapper - not to be mixed up - that does not translate, but tag a hardware component in general (like a Verilog module).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a static construct and allows to emulate HDL python dialects such as MyHDL up to some extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic selection is provided by specific factory classes that are context sensitive. This means, depending on the target configuration, code is either emit to a HDL target, compiled directly into a hardware simulation or is run natively in conjunction with a simulation. This is also referred to as 'Co-Simulation'."
