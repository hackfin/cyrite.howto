    "# Simulation and verification\n",
    "\n",
    "When modelling an algorithm for output to a target language or hardware synthesis, one would - in Python - typically begin with a classic set of functions that are executed sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "For emission to hardware, the corresponding logic and signal structure is conceived, a timing/clock concept and state machines or pipelines introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the synthesizeable hardware should do the same as the prototyped algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where verification comes into play. The IRL language provides an `.evaluate()` method for generators and expressions, so that functionality can be verified - inside the Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, verification of correct functionality may occur at later stages:\n",
    "  1. Post HDL translation: correct functional description for a synthesis tool\n",
    "  2. Post mapping: Correct inference to logic elements, verification based on vendor element primitives\n",
    "  3. Post placement: Simulation including gate timings\n",
    "  \n",
    "This chapter will only elaborate on the means to do your own verification. For instance, you may want to run a Python model and a synthesized edition of it in parallel."

It can also be in fact a working hardware counterpart and the testbench would then only consist of clocks, reset and a data I/O FIFO to communicate with external software. However, a unit test typically requires a seuquential stimulus approach.\n",
