    "* Is VHDL-2019 support planned?\n",
    "\n",
    "  Not for the time being. It is unlikely that any FPGA toolchain on the market will implement the full VHDL-2019 support.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Is this a myHDL fork?\n",
    "\n",
    "  No. It is a different kernel, originally designed to *procedurally generate* HDL/RTL pipelines.\n",
    "  It was partially rewritten to be compatible with other data types, such as myHDL's `intbv` which may still serve as 'state of the art' reference implementation for bit vectors. MyHDL emulation is implemented using AST-Translation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Is functionality being back-ported into MyHDL/a fork?\n",
    "\n",
    "  No, see above. The different kernel architecture doesn't allow that.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Where is the github repository for the kernel?\n",
    "\n",
    "  There is none. The myIRL binary part of the kernel still contains proprietary code which is hosted in a private repository.\n",
    "  The cleanups for full opensource compatibility will come last.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* What is going to happen to myHDL synthesis via yosys ('jupyosys')?\n",
    "\n",
    "  See above WRT RTLIL. The myHDL support will no longer be maintained for jupyosys and remains as 'experiment only'."
