    "## What is Cyrite?\n",
    "Cyrite was previously conceived as a number of hacks and experiments to procedurally generate pipelines  under the name *pyrite*, however, since considered 'taken' by another package, it was renamed cyrite.\n",
    "The underlying, newer IRL kernel (myirl) is written in Cython - compiled Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `myirl` kernel and library basically takes care of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* create VHDL or Verilog hierarchical code from a functional hardware description in Python\n",
    "* directly synthesize to RTLIL logic elements via yosys\n",
    "* drive simulation backends (iverilog, GHDL, CXXRTL, ...) for verification\n",
    "* emulate MyHDL syntax to some extent - with major differences:\n",
    "  * Strict typing and modular I/O\n",
    "  * Expressions are mostly generators\n",
    "* allow building of high level synthesis pipelines and custom extensions\n",
    "* compile python HDL into binaries for performance and non-opensource purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "The myHDL-alike HDL entry level runs generally as 'cyrite HDL', whereas this is rather a library set than a real HDL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The internal IRL dialect again is meant for extensions. It is entirely generator based, as opposed to translation to target languages via AST, which has turned out to be more complex to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its main goal is, to separate a functional description as far as possible from an inference rule, i.e. a specification of what to create from it. It is therefore context sensitive, either in an explicit way by a decorator, or a dynamic, implicit way according to an architecture specification."

    "* Is VHDL-2019 support planned?\n",
    "\n",

    "  \n",
    "* Is this a myHDL fork?\n",
    "\n",
    "  No. It is a different kernel, originally designed to *procedurally generate* HDL/RTL pipelines.\n",
    "  It was partially rewritten to be compatible with other data types, such as myHDL's `intbv` which may still serve as 'state of the art' reference implementation for bit vectors.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Is functionality being back-ported into MyHDL/a fork?\n",
    "\n",
    "  No, see above. The different kernel architecture doesn't allow that.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Where is the github repository for the kernel?\n",
    "\n",
    "  There is none. The myIRL binary part of the kernel still contains proprietary code which is hosted in a private repository.\n",
    "  The cleanups for full opensource compatibility will come last.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* What is going to happen to myHDL synthesis via yosys ('jupyosys')?\n",
    "\n",
    "  See above WRT RTLIL. The myHDL support is no longer be maintained for jupyosys and remains as 'experiment only'."
