    "* Why VHDL, despite fading out support for vendor toolchains?\n",
    "\n",

    "  slips through. Once the VHDL tool flow is proven to be robust, other targets can be tackled.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Is VHDL-2019 support planned?\n",
    "\n",
    "  Not for the time being. It is unlikely that any FPGA toolchain on the market will implement the full VHDL-2019 support.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* What about Verilog support?\n",
    "\n",
    "  Synthesizeable Verilog can be output via yosys. However, this does not include simulation constructs, this requires the direct Verilog target output which is not complete.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Is this a myHDL fork?\n",
    "\n",
    "  No. It is a different kernel, originally designed to *procedurally generate* HDL/RTL pipelines.\n",
    "  It was partially rewritten to be compatible with other data types, such as myHDL's `intbv` which still serves as 'state of the art' reference implementation for bit vectors.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* What is going to happen to myHDL synthesis via yosys ('jupyosys')?\n",
    "\n",
    "  See above WRT RTLIL. The myHDL support will no longer be maintained for jupyosys and remains as 'experiment only' for now."
